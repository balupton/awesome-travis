```


## Scripts

The [`scripts` directory](https://github.com/bevry/awesome-travis/tree/master/scripts) contains scripts you can use.


### Tips

The scripts in this repository are their own files, which the latest are fetched. E.g.

``` yaml
install:
  - eval "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bevry/awesome-travis/master/scripts/node-install.bash)"
```

You probably want to change the `master` to the the current commit hash. For instance:

``` yaml
install:
  - eval "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bevry/awesome-travis/some-commit-hash-instead/scripts/node-install.bash)"
```

Or you could even download it into a `.travis` folder for local use instead:

``` bash
mkdir -p ./.travis
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bevry/awesome-travis/master/scripts/node-install.bash ./.travis/node-install.bash
chmod +x ./.travis/node-install.bash
```

``` yaml
install:
  - ./.travis/node-install.bash
```
