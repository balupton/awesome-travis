# Configuration:
#
# The branch name that you want tested and deployed, set correctly:
# travis env set DEPLOY_BRANCH "master" --public

# The command that will do the compilation and git push:
# travis env set DEPLOY_COMMAND "npm run deploy" --public
#
# Your git username:
# travis env set DEPLOY_USER "$GITHUB_USERNAME" --public
#
# Your git password, if using GitHub, this should probably be a new [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) with the `repo` permission:
# travis env set DEPLOY_TOKEN "$GITHUB_TOKEN"
#
# The name hat is used for the deployment commit, set to whatever:
# travis env set DEPLOY_NAME "Travis CI Deployer" --public

# The email that is used for the deployment commit, set to whatever:
# travis env set DEPLOY_EMAIL "deployer@travis-ci.org" --public
