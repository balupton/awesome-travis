# If the tests succeeded, then deploy our release to [Surge](https://surge.sh) URLs for our branch, tag, and commit.
# Useful for rendering documentation and compiling code then deploying the release,
# such that you don't need the rendered documentation and compiled code inside your source repository.
# This is beneficial because sometimes documentation will reference the current commit,
# causing a documentation recompile to always leave a dirty state - this solution avoids that,
# as documentation can be git ignored.
#
#
# Local Installation:
#
# You will need to make sure you have surge installed as a local dependency,
# using npm: npm install --save-dev surge
# using yarn: yarn add --dev surge
#
#
# Installation:
#
# after_success:
#   - eval "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bevry/awesome-travis/master/scripts/surge.bash)"
#
#
# Configuration:
#
# Set your `SURGE_LOGIN` which is your surge.sh username
# travis env set SURGE_LOGIN "$SURGE_LOGIN" --public
#
# Set your `SURGE_TOKEN` (which you can get via the `surge token` command)
# travis env set SURGE_TOKEN "$SURGE_TOKEN"
#
# Set the path that you want to deploy to surge
# travis env set SURGE_PROJECT "." --public
